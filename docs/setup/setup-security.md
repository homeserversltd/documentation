# Vault & Security Configuration

## Encryption Key Setup

### Creating Your Vault
- **Navigate to the Admin tab** in the interface
- **Set up a new encryption key** with the vault system
- **Store your recovery key safely** - this cannot be recovered if lost

### Key Management Best Practices
- **Use a strong, unique passphrase** for your vault
- **Write down recovery information** and store it securely offline
- **Consider using a password manager** to generate and store keys
- **Never share your encryption keys** with unauthorized users

### Recovery Key Storage
- **Print physical copies** and store in multiple secure locations
- **Use a safety deposit box** or fireproof safe
- **Avoid digital storage** of recovery keys on connected devices
- **Test recovery process** periodically to ensure keys work

## Storage Security

### USB Drive Configuration
- **Configure any connected USB drives** that will participate as your device's NAS storage
- **Set a strong password** for both the vault and any attached storage devices
- **Enable encryption** for all storage volumes

### Storage Encryption Options
- **Full disk encryption** for maximum security
- **File-level encryption** for selective protection
- **Automatic encryption** for new files and folders
- **Cross-platform compatibility** considerations

### Storage Management
- **Monitor storage health** regularly
- **Set up automated backups** of encrypted data
- **Configure redundancy** if multiple drives are available
- **Plan for storage expansion** as needs grow

## Access Control Configuration

### User Management
- **Review user permissions** and create additional accounts if needed
- **Set appropriate access levels** for each user
- **Configure service-specific permissions** as needed

### Permission Levels
- **Administrator**: Full system access and configuration
- **Power User**: Service management and advanced features
- **Standard User**: Basic service access and personal data
- **Guest**: Limited access to shared resources

### Network Security
- **Configure network access rules** for enhanced security
- **Set up firewall rules** if needed
- **Enable intrusion detection** if available
- **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity

## Backup Authentication Methods

### Recovery Options
- **Set up backup authentication methods** if available
- **Configure emergency access codes** for system recovery
- **Enable administrator recovery** through secure channels

### Security Monitoring
- **Enable login notifications** for security awareness
- **Set up failed login alerts** to detect attacks
- **Configure session monitoring** for unusual activity
- **Review security logs** regularly

## Advanced Security Features

### Network Isolation
- **Configure VLANs** if supported by your network
- **Set up guest network isolation** for visitor access
- **Enable network segmentation** for critical services

### Certificate Management
- **Generate SSL certificates** for secure connections
- **Configure certificate auto-renewal** to prevent expiration
- **Set up certificate monitoring** for security compliance

### Security Hardening
- **Disable unnecessary services** to reduce attack surface
- **Configure automatic security updates** for critical patches
- **Enable security scanning** if available
- **Set up intrusion prevention** systems

## Troubleshooting Security Issues

### Common Problems
- **Forgotten passwords**: Use recovery methods and backup codes
- **Certificate errors**: Verify certificate validity and renewal
- **Access denied**: Check user permissions and account status

### Recovery Procedures
- **Emergency access methods** for locked accounts
- **System recovery options** for critical failures
- **Data recovery procedures** for encrypted storage
