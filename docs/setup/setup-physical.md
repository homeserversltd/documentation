# Physical Setup & Connection

## Hardware Requirements

Your HomeServer package includes everything you need to get started:

- **Power adapter** included with your HomeServer
- **Ethernet cable** for network connectivity
- **USB storage devices** (optional, for expanded NAS storage)

## Initial Connection

### Step 1: Physical Setup
- **Connect your device** following the included hardware setup guide
- **Ensure network connectivity** via Ethernet cable to your router/switch
- **Power on the device** and wait for the boot sequence to complete (typically 2-3 minutes)

### Step 2: Network Integration
- **Verify network connectivity** by checking your router's connected devices
- **Note the assigned IP address** for troubleshooting if needed
- **Ensure firewall settings** allow local network communication

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### Common Issues
- **No network connectivity**: Check cable connections and router status
- **Device not appearing**: Verify DHCP is enabled on your router
- **Slow boot times**: Allow up to 5 minutes for initial setup

### Network Requirements
- **DHCP enabled** on your local router
- **Standard home network** (192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x ranges)
- **No network isolation** between devices
