## ðŸ“… Certificate Expiration Reminder

SSL/TLS certificates expire every 2 years maximum due to browser security policies. When certificates expire, browsers will show security warnings. It's just a reminder that it's time to renew.

**What happens when certificates expire:**
- Browsers display security warnings.
- Users see "Your connection is not private" or similar messages
- Unimpeded HTTPS access is blocked until the certificate is renewed

**Simple solution:** Set a calendar reminder for 1-2 months before your certificate expires, and follow the renewal process below.
